# Wealth of 1 Percent

This dataset was obtained from FRED which shows the share of total net worth held by the top 1%. It is represented over time.

```{r wealth}
Wealth1percent <- read_excel("../Data/Wealth1percent.xlsx",
col_types = c("date", "numeric","numeric"))
```

This gives us a range of data from the third quarter of 1989 to the first quarter of 2021

## Time Series Plot


```{r wealthplot , message=F}
ts_model <- lm(Share ~ TimeCounter, data = Wealth1percent)


plot(Wealth1percent$TimeCounter,Wealth1percent$Share, type = "l")
abline(ts_model,lty = 2, col = "red")
```


## Time Series Regression

We can see the trend in an upwards manner, let's see what the quarterly change in slope is:

```{r wealth regression}
summary(ts_model)
```

in this case, the share of wealth held by the top 1% is increasing by 0.05% each quarter.

## Prediction

Suppose we want to predict the share of wealth 2 quarters form now:

```{r}
newForecast <- data.frame(TimeCounter = max(Wealth1percent$TimeCounter) + 2)

predict(ts_model, newdata = newForecast)
```


# Covid cases NYT

This data was pulled for March 2020 for covid cases in the US

```{r}
Covid <- read_excel("../Data/Covid.xlsx")
```

## Plot

```{r}
ts_model <- lm(cases ~ Day, data = Covid)


plot(Covid$Day,Covid$cases, type = "l")
abline(ts_model,lty = 2, col = "red")

```

## Regression

```{r}
summary(ts_model)
```


## Prediction

What would be the predicted number of cases by April 15, 2020?

```{r}
newForecast <- data.frame(Day = 46)

predict(ts_model, newdata = newForecast, level = "confidence")
```

## Thing 2 

On average, how many new cases of covid are there daily?

```{r}
ts_model$coefficients[2]

```
